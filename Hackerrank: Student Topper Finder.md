# # 🔢 Hackerrank:# 🏆 Student Topper Finder

This Python program helps determine the **top-performing student** based on the total marks across five subjects. It uses a dictionary to store each student’s marks and identifies the topper using simple calculations and built-in functions.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To maintain a dictionary of students with their marks in five subjects, calculate their **total marks**, store them in a new dictionary, and identify the **student with the highest total (topper)**.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Start** the program.
2. Create a dictionary `student_marks`:
   - Keys → Student names.
   - Values → List of marks in five subjects.
3. Initialize an empty dictionary `total_marks`.
4. Loop through `student_marks`:
   - Calculate the total marks using `sum()`.
   - Store the result in `total_marks`.
5. Use `max()` on `total_marks` to find the student with the highest total.
6. Print:
   - The `total_marks` dictionary.
   - The **topper's name and score**.

## 💻 PROGRAM:
```
student_marks = {
    "Alice": [85, 90, 78, 92, 88],
    "Bob": [80, 70, 75, 85, 90],
    "Charlie": [95, 88, 92, 91, 89],
    "David": [70, 65, 80, 75, 60]
}

total_marks = {}

for student, marks in student_marks.items():
    total = sum(marks)
    total_marks[student] = total

topper = max(total_marks, key=total_marks.get)

print("Total Marks of Students:", total_marks)
print("Topper:", topper, "with", total_marks[topper], "marks")
```
